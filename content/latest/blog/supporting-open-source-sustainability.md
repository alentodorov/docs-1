		<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Happy New Year everyone! We on the AMP team have a New Year’s resolution that we hope will be widely shared through the industry: We want to ensure the open source projects we depend on can be maintained in a way that is sustainable for their respective core teams.</span></p>
<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">As an open source project itself, AMP is fortunate to have the benefit of support from a full time team at Google, along with many more contributors backed by their respective employers. However, not every open source project has that type of financing to pay the bills, or they might actively seek out being independent of direct corporate financial support. </span></p>
<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">This is not a sustainable state for many open source projects—the authors and maintainers of those projects need to make a living. Thankfully projects such as </span><a href="https://opencollective.com/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Open Collective</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> have started to provide an alternative model that allows users of open source projects to contribute financially to their work. We, the AMP project, want to be part of that solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Last summer AMP started making regular contributions to Babel. Today we are extending that support and pledging to make funds available to more projects that we depend on as they start to accept donations.</span></p>
<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Starting in January, we’ll contribute with monthly recurring donations to </span><a href="https://babeljs.io/"><b>Babel</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> (which we heavily use in our development setup), </span><a href="https://preactjs.com/"><b>Preact</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> (which we are planning to use in future projects), and </span><a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><b>Webpack</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> (because they are awesome and we use it in our </span><a href="https://ampstart.com/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">AMP Start</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> project).</span></p>
