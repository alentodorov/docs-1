Congratulations! You just created an interactive e-commerce product detail page with variable sizes and prices for each SKU, fetched on-demand from a remote JSON endpoint.

You learned how to:

- Use [`<amp-state>`](/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html#state) to fetch product information (color, size, availability).
- Use [`<amp-bind>`](/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html) to create cross-element interactions.
- Create a fast and rich user experience with AMP!

If you got stuck, see the [`static/final.html`](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/advanced-interactivity-in-amp/blob/master/static/final.html) file for the complete solution.


## Next steps

Learn more about the power and flexibility of building interactive AMP pages in the  [`<amp-bind>`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html) documentation and from other [dynamic AMP components](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components#dynamic-content).
