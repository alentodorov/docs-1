- Track simple patterns with [amp-analytics](/docs/reference/components/amp-analytics.html)
- Add site navigation to your page with [amp-sidebar](/docs/reference/components/amp-sidebar.html)
- Use custom fonts in AMP

## You'll build:

A news article page that conforms to AMP specifications and incorporates advertising, analytics, embedded video, embedded social media, carousels, and a site navigation menu.
