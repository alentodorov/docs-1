Here are some quick tips to improve user engagement with AMP.

### Help readers identify you with consistent branding and rich content across AMP and non-AMP pages

- **Reflect your brand in AMP pages.** Use the same header and design scheme (e.g. colors, spacing, type styles) as in your non-AMP pages to ensure your pages are recognizable and appear legitimate.

- **Feature your most engaging content** when converting your pages. Include key page elements like images, videos, embeds, structured data, comments and social media. Learn how to [include 3rd-party content](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/third_party_components).

- **Keep AMP pages current.** Dynamically update live blogs with [`amp-live-list`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-live-list).

### Optimize for user engagement and retention

- **Provide interactive experiences** on your AMP pages. Use components like [`amp-carousel`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-carousel) to create rich image carousels and [`amp-iframe`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-iframe) to
incorporate interactive elements that AMP does not natively support.

- **Create personalized user journeys.** Offer a login button, and if your content
lives behind a paywall, implement your rules and offers using [`amp-access`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-access).

- **Extend onward journeys.** Link to related or suggested articles and other
relevant sections of your site.

- **Personalize content** by including recommendations through [`amp-list`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-list).

- **Implement a menu** with [`amp-sidebar`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-sidebar) to encourage users to browse the rest
of your site.

- **Help readers share your content** with [`amp-social-share`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-social-share) and your
own share buttons.

- **Cultivate new interactions** such as lead generation, newsletter signup, and
comment support with [`amp-form`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-form).

- **Aim for ad types that offer a good reader experience.** Explore AMP ad
formats such as [`amp-sticky-ad`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-sticky-ad) and [`amp-fx-flying-carpet`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-fx-flying-carpet). Follow ads
monetization [best practices](/docs/guides/ads/ads_tips.html).

- **Drive app downloads.** Include an app install link in a banner with
[`amp-app-banner`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-app-banner).

- **Ensure a fast transition** to your non-AMP Progressive Web App (PWA) site for
readers. Use [`amp-install-serviceworker`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-install-serviceworker) to populate your cache.

### Participate in the open-source AMP Project to help shape its development

- **Watch the AMP roadmap** for updates and features at [ampproject.org/roadmap](https://www.ampproject.org/roadmap).

- **Get involved.** Contribute source code, file bugs, or offer feedback
on [GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Share your input about AMP at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amp-html).

- **Learn** how to use AMP components with [AMP by Example](https://ampbyexample.com/).
